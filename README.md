# Tic-Tac-Toe

A quick project I'm putting together to get an initial jump into front-end development.

## About This Project

*In this project*, I plan to create a very basic implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe, allowing for users to play against a computer randomly generating moves, a computer using the minimax algorithm to produce the best moves (an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI), and the ability to play other players.

Currently, I only plan to have players able to play eachother locally, but I might try to expand this to allow for players to play over the internet.

I used [this writeup by Ayushman Bilas Thakur](https://dev.to/ayushmanbthakur/how-to-make-tic-tac-toe-in-browser-with-html-css-and-js-28ed) to get me started, but I intend to build upon this past what was presented in the article.

## Goals For This Project

* Learn more HTML, CSS, and especially Javascript
* Work on understanding of AI in zero-sum games
* Bridge understanding between building something that's functional and something that's actually presentable
* (Possibly) learn how to interface between a client and server for web-based multiplayer games
* (Possibly) learn how to make small webapps usable on different viewports, including desktop and mobile devices.

## Future Goals

Shortly after completing this, I intend to create a similar project for Chess, which is really only a slightly more complicated version of Tic-Tac-Toe if you choose not to think too hard about it.
